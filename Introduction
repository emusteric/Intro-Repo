Hello!

First upload.

Edit. Not going too well, but that's part of the fun.

PowerShell function to create a new Git Repo, plenty to learn there... Especially running non PowerShell syntax in a PowerShell function...

Still, lot of fun. 

Shout out to Mike Pfeiffer and CloudSkills.io for inspiring this stuff, check em out. And Nine Inch Nails for the excellent background noise.
